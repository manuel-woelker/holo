### 18:30 - Add parser failure example in testing docs [Codex GPT-5]

**User Prompt:**
add an example for a parser failure

**Issues Encountered:**
- Model identifier not exposed in available system configuration.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a `fails-parse` example case to `docs/TESTING.md`.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Using "Codex GPT-5" as the model identifier based on the system prompt because no explicit model ID was visible in local config.

**Other Notes:**

### 18:32 - Align failure annotation example format [Codex GPT-5]

**User Prompt:**
No, update the docs like this:
```holo
fn bad() -> i64 { 1i64 + 2.0f64; }
```

```fails-typecheck
error: cannot add `i64` and `f64`
```
```

**Issues Encountered:**
- Model identifier not exposed in available system configuration.

**Decisions Made:**
- Updated failure examples to use `holo` input blocks with `fails-*` output blocks.
