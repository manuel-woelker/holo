**User Prompt:**
implement the plan docs\plans\2026-02-23-markdown-testing-infrastructure-plan.md , you were interrupted at milestone 5

**Issues Encountered:**
- `scripts/check-code.sh` could not run end-to-end in bash because `cargo` was not available on that shell PATH.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added an end-to-end fixture execution test in `conformance-tests` that runs `CompilerCore` on each markdown case and compares normalized output against the expected block.
- Added an `expect_test` snapshot for the end-to-end report output.
- Updated the end-to-end typecheck fixture expectation to match the current diagnostic message wording.
- Ran the check pipeline equivalently via PowerShell cargo commands (`fmt`, `clippy`, `test`) after the bash script environment issue.

- The active model runtime ID is not directly exposed in environment variables; used `gpt-5-codex` with a note plus `codex-cli 0.104.0` from system info.

**Other Notes:**
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all`, `cargo clippy --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features --no-deps -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features` all passed.
### 19:53 - Document markdown conformance usage and contributor workflow [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
commit, then implemente the next step

**Issues Encountered:**
- `scripts/check-code.sh` still fails in this environment because bash cannot resolve `cargo` on PATH.

**Decisions Made:**
- Updated `docs/TESTING.md` with explicit contributor guidance for markdown conformance suites.
- Added concrete instructions for adding end-to-end cases without writing new Rust tests.
- Documented which suites are currently executed versus fixture-loading validation.
- Kept command guidance aligned with the conformance crate entry points.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-23-markdown-testing-infrastructure-plan.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-23-markdown-testing-infrastructure-plan.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- The user intended path fixes in the plan document to align with the actual fixture location.

**Other Notes:**
- Documentation-only change; no test behavior changed.
### 20:20 - Add executable conformance runner CLI [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
add an executable main to conformance-tests that runs all the conformance tests and reports the results

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial conformance runner execution surfaced two stale expected diagnostics in `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/basic.md`.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added `crates/conformance-tests/src/main.rs` to execute all fixture suites (`parser`, `typechecker`, `interpreter`, `end_to_end`) and report suite/total pass-fail counts.
- Implemented mismatch reporting with expected/actual kind and text for each failing case.
- Exits with status code `1` when failures are present and `0` when all cases pass.
- Moved `holo-core` from dev-dependencies to regular dependencies so the binary can run `CompilerCore`.
- Updated stale typechecker fixture expectations to current diagnostic text.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conformance-tests/Cargo.toml`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/basic.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Running all conformance tests should include all fixture suites, not only end-to-end fixtures.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` and verified `10/10` passing cases.
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
### 20:25 - Require full pretty diagnostics in conformance failure expectations [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
For failure cases the expected output should include the whole pretty printed diagnostic message

**Issues Encountered:**
- Existing fixtures only asserted single-line `error: ...` messages, causing mismatches once full diagnostics were enforced.

**Decisions Made:**
- Updated conformance execution logic (library harness + executable runner) to compare failure cases against full annotated diagnostic output via `render_annotated()`.
- Added synthetic `DiagnosticKind::Test` rendering for interpreter failures using failure span and source excerpt so runtime failures also produce full pretty diagnostics.
- Updated parser/typechecker/interpreter/end-to-end fixture expected outputs to full multi-line diagnostics.
- Updated `docs/TESTING.md` guidance to require full pretty diagnostic output for failure blocks.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/main.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/parser/basic.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/basic.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/basic.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/end_to_end/basic.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- `render_annotated()` output is the intended “pretty printed diagnostic message” format for markdown fixture expectations.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all`.

- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (10/10 cases passing).
### 20:28 - Rename conformance fixture files to descriptive names [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
rename all the basic.md files into something better, like test-parser.md

**Issues Encountered:**
- Encountered a temporary `.git/index.lock` conflict during rename sequencing.

**Decisions Made:**
- Renamed fixture files from generic `basic.md` names to descriptive suite-specific names.
- Updated fixture path references in `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs` test loaders to the new filenames.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/parser/test-parser.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/test-interpreter.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/end_to_end/test-end-to-end.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Descriptive per-suite fixture naming should remain one primary fixture file per suite.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (10/10 passing).
### 20:31 - Discover conformance fixtures by directory walking in tests [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
rather than explicitly enumerate the test files, walk the directory and test all files

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Replaced hardcoded per-file conformance fixture tests with directory-driven discovery under `tests/conformance-tests/*`.
- Added a loader test that validates every discovered markdown fixture has cases, a `holo` block, and an expected output block.
- Added an execution test that runs every discovered case and validates expected output against actual output.
- Kept `expect_test` snapshot coverage by snapshotting the aggregate report generated from all discovered fixtures.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Fixture suites remain organized under top-level suite directories (`parser`, `typechecker`, `interpreter`, `end_to_end`).

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all`.
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
### 20:37 - Use Unicode diagnostic rendering for conformance comparison [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
remove the plain ascii style rendering, for the conformance tests, use the colored unicode variant, but remove ansi color codes before comparing

**Issues Encountered:**
- Existing fixtures and snapshots were authored against plain `render_annotated()` output and needed full updates to Unicode diagnostic formatting.

**Decisions Made:**
- Switched conformance rendering in both test harness and executable runner from `render_annotated()` to `display_source_diagnostics(...)`.
- Added ANSI stripping and normalization helpers before text comparison so fixtures assert stable Unicode output without color escape sequences.
- Updated all failure fixture blocks and aggregate snapshot expectations to Unicode diagnostics.
- Updated docs to clarify that expected diagnostics are Unicode and ANSI is stripped before comparison.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/base/src/source_diagnostic.rs`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/main.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/parser/test-parser.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/test-interpreter.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/end_to_end/test-end-to-end.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- The requested "colored unicode variant" maps to `display_source_diagnostics(...)`, with ANSI stripped for fixture assertions.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (10/10 passing).
### 20:46 - Refactor conformance-tests to remove duplication [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
there's a lot of duplication and redundancy in the conformance-tests crate, refactor and simplify it

**Issues Encountered:**
- `expect_test` snapshot order changed after consolidating execution flow, requiring snapshot refresh.

**Decisions Made:**
- Extracted shared conformance execution logic from `main.rs` and test internals into reusable library APIs.
- Added library-level data models and helpers for fixture discovery, case execution, normalization, ANSI stripping, and run summaries.
- Kept `main.rs` as a thin CLI wrapper that only invokes shared APIs and prints summaries/failures.
- Reworked tests to use the same library execution path (`run_conformance_fixtures`) and report formatter to avoid duplicated logic.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/main.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Centralizing conformance behavior in library APIs is preferable to split implementations across tests and binary.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all`.
- Ran `UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (10/10 passing).
### 20:53 - Migrate conformance fixtures to heading-based outcome markers [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
instead of putting the failure marker into the source identifier in the markdown, put it in a subheading above it so it is visible in the markdown. Use identifiers like "Fails typecheck", "Fails parsing", etc. to denote compiler stages.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Unit tests initially failed because helper visibility/imports in the test module did not include the new `has_succeeds_section` helper.

**Decisions Made:**
- Extended markdown parsing to capture per-case subheadings (`### ...`) and attach the active section heading to the following code block.
- Replaced fence-info-based failure markers (`fails-*`) with subheading-based mapping (`Fails parsing`, `Fails typecheck`, `Fails interpreter`, etc.).
- Added support for success cases using `### Succeeds` with no expected `text` block; expected result defaults to `ok`.
- Updated all conformance fixtures and documentation to the new visible heading format.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/parser/test-parser.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/test-interpreter.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/end_to_end/test-end-to-end.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- "Omit the source block" for success cases meant omitting the expected output block, while keeping the `holo` source block required for execution.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (10/10 passing).
### 20:46 - Move Succeeds marker below source block [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
put the succeeds below the source, so it is in the same position as the fail outcomes

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Moved all `### Succeeds` markers to appear below the `holo` code block to match the visual position of failure outcome headings.
- Updated `docs/TESTING.md` examples and contributor steps to require `### Succeeds` below source blocks.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `tests/conformance-tests/parser/test-parser.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/test-interpreter.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/end_to_end/test-end-to-end.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- No parser behavior changes are required because success detection is based on case headings, not block order.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (10/10 passing).
### 20:59 - Add conformance runner step to Rust CI workflow [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
add the conformance test execution to the github action after the build

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a dedicated `Conformance` step in `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml` directly after the `Build` step.
- The step runs `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` so CI explicitly executes markdown-driven conformance checks.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/main.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Running the conformance binary is the intended execution path for validating conformance fixtures in CI.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` locally (10/10 passing).
### 20:52 - Expand conformance fixtures for broader functionality and edge cases [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
add more conformance tests to cover the currently implemented functionality. be sure to cover edge cases. Where helpful add notes to the markdown files documenting edge case behaviour

**Issues Encountered:**
- New failure-case diagnostics needed exact text/annotation alignment; several expected blocks required iterative correction.
- Aggregate `expect_test` snapshot required refresh after adding new cases.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added substantial new markdown conformance cases across parser, typechecker, interpreter, and end-to-end suites.
- Prioritized edge cases tied to implemented behavior: unsupported attribute parsing, numeric precedence parsing, modulo-on-float type errors, call arity mismatch, duplicate locals, modulo-by-zero runtime failures, assertion runtime failures, parse-failure end-to-end blocking, and multi-test module execution.
- Added inline markdown notes (`> Edge case note: ...`) to document why each edge case exists and expected behavior.
- Kept failure expectations as full Unicode diagnostics with ANSI-stripped comparison semantics.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `tests/conformance-tests/parser/test-parser.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/test-interpreter.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/end_to_end/test-end-to-end.md`
- `crates/typechecker/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/parser/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/interpreter/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Existing language behavior should be captured as-is, including exact diagnostic phrasing and annotation spans.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (22/22 passing cases).
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` and refreshed snapshots with `UPDATE_EXPECT=1`.
- Ran `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features`.
### 20:59 - Add pre-execution conformance lint/validation checks [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
Add a check to verify that the conformance file is well formed (lint & validate), these should be run before executing a file

**Issues Encountered:**
- None after implementation; existing fixtures already satisfied the new lint invariants.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a dedicated lint pass (`lint_holo_suite`) that validates each case before any execution in a fixture file.
- Validation rules include: exactly one `holo` block, presence of an outcome heading (`### Succeeds` or `### Fails ...`), no conflicting success/failure outcomes, and correct expected-output requirements (`text` block required for failures, omitted for successes).
- If lint issues are found in a fixture file, execution for that file is skipped and lint failures are reported through the existing conformance failure/reporting paths.
- Added a focused unit test (`lints_malformed_case`) for malformed-case detection.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Lint failures should be surfaced as conformance failures (`lint-error`) so CI and CLI reporting remain unified.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all`.
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo run -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml` (22/22 passing).

**Issues Encountered:**
- The prompt used "ruct"; interpreted as "rust" based on repository context and target workflow.
- Runtime model identifier was not available via environment variables beyond Codex thread metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a dedicated `Rust cache` step to `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml` using `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`.
- Placed cache restore/save before build and test commands so cargo artifacts are reused across CI runs.
- Scoped cache workspace to `crates` to match the Rust workspace location.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml`
- `docs/journal/2026-02-23.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- The requested compilation cache targets Rust `cargo` outputs in the existing `Rust CI` workflow.

**Other Notes:**
- Pending execution of `scripts/check-code.sh` after this documentation update.
### 21:03 - Add root README with project overview and commands [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
add a readme file

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a new root `README.md` because none existed.
- Documented project purpose, repository structure, and standard Rust build/test/lint/format commands.
- Included conformance test runner usage and links to primary documentation locations.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.github/workflows/rust-ci.yml`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- The request targets a repository-level README at `README.md`.

**Other Notes:**
- Pending validation command execution after file updates.
### 21:05 - Mark README as work in progress [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
add a note up top that this is a work in progress

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a prominent top-level note in `README.md` indicating the project is a work in progress.
- Kept the note concise and placed directly under the title for immediate visibility.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `README.md`
- `docs/journal/2026-02-23.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- "Up top" means directly below the `# holo` heading.

**Other Notes:**
- Documentation-only change; no code/tests affected.
### 21:06 - Add top-level motivation link to README [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
also add a link up top for the motivation https://manuel-woelker.github.io/blog/posts/2026-02-23-i-wish-i-had-a-hot-reloading-compiler/

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a `Motivation` line near the top of `README.md` directly below the existing work-in-progress note.
- Kept the link as a plain URL for maximum visibility and copyability.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `README.md`
- `docs/journal/2026-02-23.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- "Up top" means adjacent to the existing introductory notes under the project title.

**Other Notes:**
- Documentation-only change; no code/tests affected.
### 21:11 - Resolve workspace clippy errors in conformance parser loop handling [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
fix all clippy issues and commit

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Replaced `while let Some((_, inner)) = lines.next()` with `for (_, inner) in lines.by_ref()` in `parse_holo_suite`.
- Replaced `case.blocks.extend(pending_blocks.drain(..))` with `case.blocks.append(&mut pending_blocks)`.
- Kept behavior unchanged while satisfying strict clippy `-D warnings` checks.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**
- "all clippy issues" refers to the current workspace invocation: `cargo clippy --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo clippy --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` successfully.
- Ran `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --all-features` successfully.
### 21:28 - Add high-level compiler implementation roadmap with pending milestones [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
create a high-level plan document for this, mark all the steps as pending

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a new high-level compiler implementation plan document in `docs/plans/`.
- Used question-driven headings to align with repository documentation conventions.
- Marked every roadmap milestone explicitly as `Pending`.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-language-semantics-and-numeric-arithmetic-plan.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- "for this" refers to the previously discussed compiler implementation roadmap items.

**Other Notes:**
- Documentation-only update; no code behavior changed.
### 21:56 - Make conformance fixture paths platform-agnostic via FilePath [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
Tests fail in CI because of Windows path separators, use FilePath as well to make them platform agnostic

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Switched conformance report path fields from `SharedString` to `FilePath` for typed path handling.
- Added `display_fixture_path(...)` to normalize fixture paths to forward slashes (`/`) before storing/reporting.
- Updated conformance snapshot expectations to use normalized slash-separated fixture paths.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/cli/src/main.rs` (`display_source_path`)
- `crates/base/src/lib.rs` (`FilePath` alias)

**Assumptions Made:**
- CI failures were caused by OS-dependent rendering from `Path::display()` in conformance report snapshots.

**Other Notes:**
- Ran `cargo test -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Ran `cargo clippy -p conformance-tests --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Ran `cargo clippy --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
### 22:16 - Apply rustfmt formatting for conformance path normalization changes [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed in env)]

**User Prompt:**
0s
Run cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all -- --check

        }
        return rendered.into();
    }
-    path.to_string_lossy().into_owned().replace('\\', "/").into()
+    path.to_string_lossy()
+        .into_owned()
+        .replace('\\', "/")
+        .into()
}

pub fn fixture_paths_in_dir(path: &Path) -> Result<Vec<PathBuf>> {

Error: Process completed with exit code 1.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Runtime model identifier is not exposed in available environment metadata.

**Decisions Made:**
- Ran `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all` to align formatting with CI rustfmt expectations.
- Verified with `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all -- --check`.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/conformance-tests/src/lib.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**
- CI failure was exclusively due to rustfmt drift from the previous commit.

**Other Notes:**
- No behavioral changes; formatting-only update.
