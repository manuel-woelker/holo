### 08:08 - [Create binary CLI crate as workspace main entry point] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
create binary cli crate as main entry point

**Issues Encountered:**
- `cargo new cli --bin --vcs none` failed twice in the sandbox with `windows sandbox: setup refresh failed with status exit code: 1`.

**Decisions Made:**
- Manually scaffolded `crates/cli` with `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` to avoid blocking on sandbox command execution issues.
- Added `cli` to workspace `members` and set `default-members = ["cli"]` so workspace-level default commands target the CLI crate as the main entry point.
- Added a colocated unit test in `crates/cli/src/main.rs` to keep automated test coverage for the new behavior.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` instructions for journal and testing requirements.
- Existing workspace manifest at `crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Runtime metadata from `codex --version`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- "main entry point" means the workspace default target should be the new CLI crate.
- A minimal CLI banner output is acceptable initial behavior for the newly created entry point.

**Other Notes:**
- Follow-up can wire the CLI to real command handling once language daemon workflows are added.

### 08:16 - [Add implementation plan for minimal continuous compile-and-test compiler] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
in docs/plans, create a plan on how to implement a minimal continuously compiling and testing compiler. For now it should only support the expressions true and false, and be able to run tests annotated with the #[test] attribute.

**Issues Encountered:**
- No `docs/plans` directory existed yet, so it had to be created as part of this change.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added `docs/plans/minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md` with question-driven headings to match repository documentation strategy.
- Scoped the plan to a strict minimal language surface: only `true`/`false` expressions and `#[test]`-annotated test functions.
- Structured the plan around query-driven compilation, selective invalidation, and selective test reruns.
- Included phased milestones and explicit exit criteria to make implementation progress measurable.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` for documentation style and journal requirements.
- Existing `docs/` layout and current journal formatting in `docs/journal/2026-02-22.md`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The requested "plan" is a design/implementation roadmap document, not immediate code implementation.
- `holo` language examples in the plan can be pseudo-syntax for architectural guidance.

**Other Notes:**
- The plan includes a dedicated testing section that aligns with the repository preference for data-driven and snapshot-style tests.

### 08:19 - [Extend minimal compiler plan with assert and boolean negation] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
to verify the tests we need an assert function and boolean negation

**Issues Encountered:**
- The plan file in the repository is named `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`, so references had to target that path.

**Decisions Made:**
- Expanded the minimal expression language in the plan to include unary `!` negation.
- Added `assert(<expr>)` as the minimal test assertion primitive in test bodies.
- Updated parser/typecheck/runtime milestones, diagnostics, and exit criteria to reflect negation and assert semantics.
- Updated examples and test strategy to validate `assert(true)` pass and negated assertion failure behavior.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` requirements for journal entries.
- Existing plan content in `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The request targets updating the implementation plan rather than immediate compiler code changes.

**Other Notes:**
- This keeps the first milestone small while making test outcomes explicit and machine-verifiable.

### 08:25 - [Refine minimal compiler plan with separate crates and query layer] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
update the plan to have seperate crates for ast, lexer, parser, typechecker and interpreter. Also a separate core crate for coordinating everything. Maybe a separate query crate for the query engine?

**Issues Encountered:**
- The request included a spelling variation ("seperate"), but intent was clear and applied as "separate".

**Decisions Made:**
- Updated the plan to define explicit crate boundaries: `holo-ast`, `holo-lexer`, `holo-parser`, `holo-typechecker`, `holo-interpreter`, and `holo-core`.
- Added `holo-query` as a recommended dedicated crate for query APIs, caching, dependency tracking, and invalidation.
- Updated the pipeline, query list, and milestones to align with lexer-first flow and cross-crate responsibilities.
- Kept a fallback note allowing query logic in `holo-core` temporarily if early implementation complexity is high.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Existing plan file at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` journal/documentation requirements.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The user wanted a design-level crate decomposition update, not immediate crate scaffolding in code.

**Other Notes:**
- The revised plan now makes ownership boundaries explicit before implementation begins.
