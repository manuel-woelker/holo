### 08:08 - [Create binary CLI crate as workspace main entry point] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
create binary cli crate as main entry point

**Issues Encountered:**
- `cargo new cli --bin --vcs none` failed twice in the sandbox with `windows sandbox: setup refresh failed with status exit code: 1`.

**Decisions Made:**
- Manually scaffolded `crates/cli` with `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` to avoid blocking on sandbox command execution issues.
- Added `cli` to workspace `members` and set `default-members = ["cli"]` so workspace-level default commands target the CLI crate as the main entry point.
- Added a colocated unit test in `crates/cli/src/main.rs` to keep automated test coverage for the new behavior.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` instructions for journal and testing requirements.
- Existing workspace manifest at `crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Runtime metadata from `codex --version`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- "main entry point" means the workspace default target should be the new CLI crate.
- A minimal CLI banner output is acceptable initial behavior for the newly created entry point.

**Other Notes:**
- Follow-up can wire the CLI to real command handling once language daemon workflows are added.
