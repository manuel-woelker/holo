### 08:08 - [Create binary CLI crate as workspace main entry point] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
create binary cli crate as main entry point

**Issues Encountered:**
- `cargo new cli --bin --vcs none` failed twice in the sandbox with `windows sandbox: setup refresh failed with status exit code: 1`.

**Decisions Made:**
- Manually scaffolded `crates/cli` with `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` to avoid blocking on sandbox command execution issues.
- Added `cli` to workspace `members` and set `default-members = ["cli"]` so workspace-level default commands target the CLI crate as the main entry point.
- Added a colocated unit test in `crates/cli/src/main.rs` to keep automated test coverage for the new behavior.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` instructions for journal and testing requirements.
- Existing workspace manifest at `crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Runtime metadata from `codex --version`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- "main entry point" means the workspace default target should be the new CLI crate.
- A minimal CLI banner output is acceptable initial behavior for the newly created entry point.

**Other Notes:**
- Follow-up can wire the CLI to real command handling once language daemon workflows are added.

### 08:16 - [Add implementation plan for minimal continuous compile-and-test compiler] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
in docs/plans, create a plan on how to implement a minimal continuously compiling and testing compiler. For now it should only support the expressions true and false, and be able to run tests annotated with the #[test] attribute.

**Issues Encountered:**
- No `docs/plans` directory existed yet, so it had to be created as part of this change.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added `docs/plans/minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md` with question-driven headings to match repository documentation strategy.
- Scoped the plan to a strict minimal language surface: only `true`/`false` expressions and `#[test]`-annotated test functions.
- Structured the plan around query-driven compilation, selective invalidation, and selective test reruns.
- Included phased milestones and explicit exit criteria to make implementation progress measurable.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` for documentation style and journal requirements.
- Existing `docs/` layout and current journal formatting in `docs/journal/2026-02-22.md`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The requested "plan" is a design/implementation roadmap document, not immediate code implementation.
- `holo` language examples in the plan can be pseudo-syntax for architectural guidance.

**Other Notes:**
- The plan includes a dedicated testing section that aligns with the repository preference for data-driven and snapshot-style tests.

### 08:19 - [Extend minimal compiler plan with assert and boolean negation] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
to verify the tests we need an assert function and boolean negation

**Issues Encountered:**
- The plan file in the repository is named `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`, so references had to target that path.

**Decisions Made:**
- Expanded the minimal expression language in the plan to include unary `!` negation.
- Added `assert(<expr>)` as the minimal test assertion primitive in test bodies.
- Updated parser/typecheck/runtime milestones, diagnostics, and exit criteria to reflect negation and assert semantics.
- Updated examples and test strategy to validate `assert(true)` pass and negated assertion failure behavior.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` requirements for journal entries.
- Existing plan content in `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The request targets updating the implementation plan rather than immediate compiler code changes.

**Other Notes:**
- This keeps the first milestone small while making test outcomes explicit and machine-verifiable.

### 08:25 - [Refine minimal compiler plan with separate crates and query layer] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
update the plan to have seperate crates for ast, lexer, parser, typechecker and interpreter. Also a separate core crate for coordinating everything. Maybe a separate query crate for the query engine?

**Issues Encountered:**
- The request included a spelling variation ("seperate"), but intent was clear and applied as "separate".

**Decisions Made:**
- Updated the plan to define explicit crate boundaries: `holo-ast`, `holo-lexer`, `holo-parser`, `holo-typechecker`, `holo-interpreter`, and `holo-core`.
- Added `holo-query` as a recommended dedicated crate for query APIs, caching, dependency tracking, and invalidation.
- Updated the pipeline, query list, and milestones to align with lexer-first flow and cross-crate responsibilities.
- Kept a fallback note allowing query logic in `holo-core` temporarily if early implementation complexity is high.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Existing plan file at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` journal/documentation requirements.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The user wanted a design-level crate decomposition update, not immediate crate scaffolding in code.

**Other Notes:**
- The revised plan now makes ownership boundaries explicit before implementation begins.

### 08:31 - [Implement project wiring milestone with dedicated compiler crates] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
implement the next step, mark the milestones as In Progress or Done so we can keep track of our progress

**Issues Encountered:**
- Existing `holo-token` crate is present in the repository but not part of current workspace members, so wiring focused on the plan's requested crate boundaries without reintroducing unrelated membership changes.

**Decisions Made:**
- Implemented Milestone 1 by scaffolding and wiring new crates: `holo-ast`, `holo-lexer`, `holo-parser`, `holo-typechecker`, `holo-interpreter`, `holo-core`, and `holo-query`.
- Added minimal, compilable interfaces and baseline tests in each new crate to support iterative milestone delivery.
- Added `holo-core::CompilerCore` as a coordination entry point that executes lex/parse/typecheck/interpreter stages and records query stage values.
- Updated workspace members in `crates/Cargo.toml` to include the new crates.
- Updated plan milestone statuses to track progress (`Done` for project wiring, remaining milestones marked `In Progress`).

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`.
- Existing workspace manifest in `crates/Cargo.toml`.
- Existing error/span infrastructure in `crates/base`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- "next step" refers to Milestone 1 (`Project wiring`) from the active plan.
- Tracking visibility is best represented directly in the milestone titles with status labels.

**Other Notes:**
- Current parser/typechecker/interpreter implementations are intentionally minimal and serve as milestone scaffolding rather than full language completeness.

### 08:32 - [Remove IR references from minimal compiler plan] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed; codex-cli 0.104.0)]

**User Prompt:**
remove the IR references in the plan, for now we only need an interpreter, then commit

**Issues Encountered:**
- IR terminology appeared in multiple sections (crate descriptions, pipeline, query list, and milestones), requiring coordinated updates to keep the plan internally consistent.

**Decisions Made:**
- Removed lowering/IR steps from the pipeline and switched to AST-based typechecking followed directly by interpreter execution.
- Removed the `lower_file` query from the query list.
- Renamed milestone `Typecheck + IR` to `Typecheck` and updated its description to AST-only semantics.
- Kept query-engine and crate-boundary structure unchanged, since those remain relevant without IR.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` journal entry requirements.

**Assumptions Made:**
- "for now we only need an interpreter" means the plan should avoid introducing any intermediate IR layer in this phase.

**Other Notes:**
- This narrows early implementation scope and keeps milestone sequencing aligned with interpreter-first delivery.
