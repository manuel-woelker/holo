### 19:56 - [Create high-level language design document] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed)]

**User Prompt:**
Write a high level design document for the language in docs/DESIGN.md. Ask if you have any questions.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Repository did not yet contain a `docs/` directory; required creating documentation paths.
- Runtime environment variables did not expose a precise model identifier string.

**Decisions Made:**
- Wrote `docs/DESIGN.md` with question-driven headings to match repository documentation strategy.
- Focused on architecture, goals, non-goals, testing integration, and roadmap at a high level (without locking in low-level implementation details).
- Recorded the model name using the available runtime context and noted the missing exact identifier explicitly.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` instructions for documentation and journal format.
- Repository root structure to determine missing directories.
- Environment metadata (`Env:` variables, `codex --version`) to identify available model/runtime details.

**Assumptions Made:**
- A conceptual design document was preferred over syntax-level language specification at this stage.
- Local date/time (`2026-02-21`, `19:56`) should be used for journal entry timestamp.

**Other Notes:**
- `Cargo.toml` is not present in the current repository snapshot, so Rust formatting/lint checks are not runnable here yet.

### 20:00 - [Add query-driven compiler design details] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed)]

**User Prompt:**
add that the compiler should be query driven, and detail what that means for the compiler design in docs\DESIGN.md

**Issues Encountered:**
- No implementation code exists yet, so query-driven guidance had to remain architectural rather than API-specific.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a dedicated section stating that the compiler should be query driven.
- Added architecture implications: stable query keys, dependency tracking, deterministic query behavior, layered query APIs, and demand-driven scheduling.
- Extended compilation model language to explicitly describe compilation as query evaluation and added practical query categories (parsing, semantic, codegen, diagnostics, test selection).

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Existing `docs/DESIGN.md` structure and terminology.
- `AGENTS.md` requirements for journal formatting and question-driven documentation style.

**Assumptions Made:**
- "Detail what that means" should be captured at high-level architecture depth, not low-level rust module signatures.

**Other Notes:**
- Existing document style (question headings) was preserved for consistency.

### 20:01 - [Add query pseudo-API examples to design doc] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed)]

**User Prompt:**
do that

**Issues Encountered:**
- Needed to keep examples implementation-agnostic while still concrete enough to guide architecture.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a dedicated "What Could A Query API Look Like?" section in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- Used Rust-like pseudo-code to match the project's host language and make query contracts explicit.
- Included both query entry points (`QueryContext`) and engine mechanics (`QueryEngine`) to clarify memoization and invalidation behavior.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Existing query-driven sections in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` documentation and journal requirements.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The user intended "do that" to mean adding the previously suggested pseudo-API section.

**Other Notes:**
- The code block is intentionally pseudo-code and not intended to compile as-is.
