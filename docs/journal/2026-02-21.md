### 19:56 - [Create high-level language design document] [gpt-5-codex (exact runtime model ID not exposed)]

**User Prompt:**
Write a high level design document for the language in docs/DESIGN.md. Ask if you have any questions.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Repository did not yet contain a `docs/` directory; required creating documentation paths.
- Runtime environment variables did not expose a precise model identifier string.

**Decisions Made:**
- Wrote `docs/DESIGN.md` with question-driven headings to match repository documentation strategy.
- Focused on architecture, goals, non-goals, testing integration, and roadmap at a high level (without locking in low-level implementation details).
- Recorded the model name using the available runtime context and noted the missing exact identifier explicitly.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `AGENTS.md` instructions for documentation and journal format.
- Repository root structure to determine missing directories.
- Environment metadata (`Env:` variables, `codex --version`) to identify available model/runtime details.

**Assumptions Made:**
- A conceptual design document was preferred over syntax-level language specification at this stage.
- Local date/time (`2026-02-21`, `19:56`) should be used for journal entry timestamp.

**Other Notes:**
- `Cargo.toml` is not present in the current repository snapshot, so Rust formatting/lint checks are not runnable here yet.
