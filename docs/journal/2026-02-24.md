### 16:32 - Implement lexical scope and symbol resolution milestone in typechecker [gpt-5.3-codex]

**User Prompt:**
read docs\plans\2026-02-23-compiler-implementation-roadmap.md and implement milestone 1

**Issues Encountered:**
- `scripts/check-code.sh` could not find `cargo` in the bash environment on this machine.

**Decisions Made:**
- Introduced an explicit lexical `ScopeStack` plus `SymbolEntry`/`SymbolKind` in `holo-typechecker` to replace flat local-only lookup.
- Modeled function checking with two nested scopes (parameter scope and body scope) so local bindings can shadow parameters while duplicate names in the same scope remain errors.
- Kept duplicate-local diagnostic wording stable to avoid changing existing conformance snapshots.
- Upgraded duplicate-parameter diagnostics to annotate both first and duplicate declarations for clearer span-aware resolution errors.
- Marked Milestone 1 as `Done` in the roadmap file after implementation.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-23-compiler-implementation-roadmap.md`
- `crates/typechecker/src/lib.rs`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`
- `scripts/check-code.sh`
- `$HOME/.codex/config.toml` (to confirm model identifier)

**Assumptions Made:**
- Milestone 1 focuses on frontend semantic symbol resolution in typechecking, with parser/runtime scope changes deferred to later control-flow/block milestones.
- Existing conformance output for duplicate local binding should remain unchanged unless explicitly requested.

**Other Notes:**
- Executed equivalent check pipeline manually with:
  - `cargo fmt --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all`
  - `cargo clippy --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features --no-deps -- -D warnings`
  - `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features`

### 16:49 - Implement control-flow milestone with if/while/block semantics [gpt-5.3-codex]

**User Prompt:**
commit and implement the next step

**Issues Encountered:**
- Needed coordinated AST/lexer/parser/typechecker/interpreter updates to keep expression semantics and tests aligned across crates.

**Decisions Made:**
- Implemented `if`, `while`, and block constructs as expression forms in the AST (`ExprKind::{If, While, Block}`) with block trailing-expression semantics.
- Added lexer keywords (`if`, `else`, `while`) and parser support for:
  - `if <cond> { ... } [else { ... }]`
  - `while <cond> { ... }`
  - block expressions with optional trailing result expression.
- Extended typechecker semantics to:
  - require boolean conditions for `if` and `while`,
  - require branch type consistency for `if`,
  - require `while` body type to be `()`,
  - typecheck block expressions in nested lexical scopes and return their trailing expression type (or `()`).
- Extended interpreter runtime to execute control-flow expressions using runtime lexical scope stacks, including block-local bindings and loop execution.
- Marked roadmap milestone 2 (`Control Flow Constructs`) as `Done`.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-23-compiler-implementation-roadmap.md`
- `crates/ast/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/lexer/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/parser/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/typechecker/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/interpreter/src/lib.rs`

**Assumptions Made:**
- `if` without `else` evaluates to `()` when used as an expression.
- Block expressions use their trailing non-semicolon expression as value and otherwise evaluate to `()`.
- Loop evaluation follows current interpreter/runtime model without introducing control-flow statements like `break`/`continue` in this milestone.

**Other Notes:**
- Added unit coverage in parser/typechecker/interpreter/lexer crates for control-flow parsing, branch/body typing, and runtime scoping behavior.
