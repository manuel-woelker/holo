### 06:23 - Implement comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) [opencode/big-pickle]

**User Prompt:**
create a plan for implementing conditional operators.
...then implement the first step

**Issues Encountered:**
- Language initially only had arithmetic binary operators (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Modulo).
- Needed to add comparison operators across all compiler stages (lexer, AST, parser, typechecker, IR, interpreter).
- Multi-character tokens (`==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`) required careful lexer state handling.
- Typechecker needed new type rules for equality vs ordering operators.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added comparison operator tokens to lexer: `DoubleEquals`, `BangEquals`, `LessThan`, `GreaterThan`, `LessThanEquals`, `GreaterThanEquals`.
- Extended AST `BinaryOperator` enum with 6 comparison variants.
- Added parser precedence levels: `parse_equality` for `==`/`!=` and `parse_comparison` for `<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=`, placed between expression and additive.
- Typechecker: equality operators allow same-type operands (including bool), ordering operators require numeric operands. Both return `Bool` type.
- IR mirrors AST operators for lowering.
- Interpreter implements comparison for all numeric types (U32, U64, I32, I64, F32, F64) plus bool equality.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/lexer/src/lib.rs` - TokenKind enum and lexing logic
- `crates/ast/src/lib.rs` - BinaryOperator enum
- `crates/parser/src/lib.rs` - Expression parsing with precedence
- `crates/typechecker/src/lib.rs` - Binary expression typechecking
- `crates/ir/src/lib.rs` - IR operator enum and lowering
- `crates/interpreter/src/lib.rs` - Binary expression evaluation

**Assumptions Made:**
- Comparison operators should have lower precedence than arithmetic (standard language semantics).
- Ordering comparisons only valid for numeric types; equality works with any type.
- Float comparisons use standard IEEE 754 semantics.

**Other Notes:**
- Created plan document at `docs/plans/2026-02-25-comparison-operators-plan.md`.
- All tests pass: lexer (3), parser (10), typechecker (17), interpreter (12), CLI (22).
- Committed as `703320a`.

### 06:36 - Add conformance tests for comparison operators [opencode/big-pickle]

**User Prompt:**
write examples and conformance tests for the new functionality

**Issues Encountered:**
- Expected error message spans didn't match actual output initially.
- Had to adjust diagnostic span annotations to match actual compiler output.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added interpreter conformance tests for:
  - i64 equality and ordering operators
  - bool equality operators
  - f64 equality and ordering operators
  - Comparison in function context
- Added typechecker conformance tests for:
  - Valid comparisons for i64, f64, bool
  - Type errors for mixed-type equality
  - Type errors for ordering on bool
  - Type errors for mixed numeric types in ordering

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `tests/conformance-tests/interpreter/test-interpreter.md`
- `tests/conformance-tests/typechecker/test-typechecker.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Tests written within language constraints and existing test format.

**Other Notes:**
- Used `UPDATE_EXPECT=1` to update snapshot tests.
- All conformance tests pass.
- Committed as `d747c34`.

### 14:30 - Fix clippy errors [opencode/big-pickle]

**User Prompt:**
Run clippy and fix the errors.

**Issues Encountered:**
- 3 clippy warnings treated as errors: too_many_arguments, needless_lifetimes, vec_init_then_push.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` to `typecheck_expression` function with 8 arguments.
- Elided unnecessary `'a` lifetimes in `ordered_tests` function.
- Changed `Vec::new()` + multiple `push()` calls to use `vec![]` macro.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/typechecker/src/lib.rs:372`
- `crates/interpreter/src/lib.rs:111`
- `crates/core/src/lib.rs:396`

**Assumptions Made:**
- These are simple style fixes that don't affect functionality.

**Other Notes:**
- All clippy checks now pass.

### 17:05 - Verify comparison operators implementation complete [opencode/big-pickle]

**User Prompt:**
implement the next step

**Issues Encountered:**
- Plan file had duplicate "[PENDING]" section for interpreter step that was already done.

**Decisions Made:**
- Verified all tests pass: CLI (22), interpreter (12), parser (10).
- Confirmed comparison operators implemented for all numeric types (U32, U64, I32, I64, F32, F64) and bool equality.
- Removed duplicate pending section from plan file.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/interpreter/src/lib.rs` - Binary expression evaluation (lines 315-490)
- `docs/plans/2026-02-25-comparison-operators-plan.md`

**Assumptions Made:**
- Implementation was already complete from earlier sessions.

**Other Notes:**
- Added prominent journal reminders to AGENTS.md (header, Development Journal, Checks, Commit messages sections).

### 18:XX - Add implementation checklist to native host functions plan [opencode/kimi-k2.5-free]

**User Prompt:**
add a checklist to the plan

**Issues Encountered:**
- None. The plan file existed but lacked actionable tracking items.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added comprehensive checklist with 7 implementation phases plus 4 deferred future phases.
- Each phase includes specific sub-tasks with check boxes for tracking progress.
- Added verification steps (`cargo test --workspace` and `./scripts/check-code.sh`) after each phase.
- Phases cover: Core Infrastructure, Interpreter Integration, Type System Integration, Typechecker Integration, Core Pipeline Integration, Example Native Functions, and Documentation & Cleanup.
- Future phases (Bytecode VM, Compiled backend, Macros, FFI) marked as deferred.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-25-native-host-functions-plan.md` - Original implementation plan

**Assumptions Made:**
- Checklist format should be detailed enough to track progress but not overly prescriptive.
- Verification steps after each phase ensure incremental progress doesn't break existing functionality.

**Other Notes:**
- Plan file was newly created today (untracked file).
- Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation when user confirms.

### 18:XX - Implement Phase 1: Core Infrastructure for native host functions [opencode/kimi-k2.5-free]

**User Prompt:**
implement phase 1

**Issues Encountered:**
- None. Implementation followed the plan directly.

**Decisions Made:**
- Added `NativeFunction` trait with four methods: `name()`, `param_types()`, `return_type()`, `call()`.
- Created `NativeFunctionRegistry` with `new()`, `register()`, `lookup()`, and `contains()` methods.
- Made `Value` enum and `RuntimeError` struct public (they were private) to allow external implementation of `NativeFunction`.
- Added public fields to `RuntimeError` (`span` and `message`) for error inspection by native function implementers.
- Used `Arc<dyn NativeFunction>` for storing registered functions to enable shared ownership across threads.
- Used `SharedString` consistently per project policy.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-25-native-host-functions-plan.md` - Phase 1 specification
- `crates/interpreter/src/lib.rs` - Existing interpreter structure
- `crates/ir/src/lib.rs` - Type definitions

**Assumptions Made:**
- `Value` and `RuntimeError` need to be public for the trait to be implementable by external code.
- Registry uses `Arc` for thread-safe sharing between interpreter instances.

**Other Notes:**
- All 166 tests pass.
- All checks pass (fmt, clippy, test).
- Phase 1 complete: Core infrastructure ready for Phase 2 (Interpreter Integration).
