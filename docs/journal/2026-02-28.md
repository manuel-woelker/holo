### 06:15 - Transform SharedString and FilePath into wrapper types [Cascade]

**User Prompt:**
Transform SharedString and FilePath into wrapper types into their own files, make sure that the existing code compiles

**Issues Encountered:**
- Compilation errors due to missing methods in SharedString wrapper (clear, push_str, parameterless new())
- Missing Ord trait implementation for FilePath needed for sorting in daemon.rs
- Missing PartialEq implementations for SharedString to compare with &str in tests
- EcoString doesn't support mutable dereferencing, requiring careful API design
- relative_path API differences requiring method implementation adjustments

**Decisions Made:**
- Created comprehensive wrapper types with full API compatibility
- Added all necessary trait implementations (PartialEq, Ord, From, etc.)
- Maintained backward compatibility by providing all existing methods
- Used composition over inheritance to wrap the underlying types
- Added extensive test coverage for both wrapper types

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- ecow::EcoString documentation for string handling capabilities
- relative_path::RelativePathBuf API documentation
- Rust trait implementation patterns for wrapper types
- Existing codebase usage patterns to ensure compatibility

**Assumptions Made:**
- The wrapper types should maintain exactly the same public API as the original type aliases
- All existing tests should continue to pass without modification
- The wrapper types should provide additional safety and future extensibility

**Other Notes:**
- The transformation required updating multiple files that used SharedString::new() without parameters
- Added Deref implementation for SharedString to allow string-like behavior
- FilePath wrapper includes comprehensive path manipulation methods
- Both types include serde serialization support for compatibility with existing data structures
