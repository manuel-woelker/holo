### 20:30 - Remove lexeme field from Token struct [opencode/minimax-m2.5-free]

**User Prompt:**
Remove the lexeme field from the Token struct and instead make it a method that takes a &SourceFile. Adapt all relevant methods to use &SourceFiles as parameters instead of plain &str as source.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Had to fix borrow checker issues when calling `self.lexeme(token)` multiple times - had to clone the string to avoid conflicting borrows
- Had to fix `SourceExcerpt::new` calls to pass `&self.source.source` instead of `&self.source` since it expects a string type, not SourceFile

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a `lexeme(&self, source: &SourceFile) -> SharedString` method to Token that extracts the text using `source.source_at(self.span)`
- Added a helper method `fn lexeme(&self, token: &Token) -> &str` in ParserState to avoid repeated borrow issues
- Changed Parser trait and implementations to take `&SourceFile` instead of `&str`
- Created SourceFile instances in core and cli to pass to the parser

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Reviewed SourceFile::source_at method which extracts text by span
- Reviewed ParserState struct to understand how source is used

**Assumptions Made:**
- That the lexeme extraction would be simple enough to inline via the method
- That creating SourceFile instances in core/cli would be straightforward

**Other Notes:**
- All tests pass including parser and lexer tests
- check-code.sh passes with no issues

### 22:05 - Move Token type from lexer crate to token crate [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
move the Token type from the lexer crate to the token crate, replacing the token type there

**Issues Encountered:**
- None. The transition was straightforward because the placeholder `Token` in the `token` crate was minimal and could be entirely replaced by the version from `lexer`.

**Decisions Made:**
- Replaced `Token` and `TokenKind` in `holo-token` with the full implementations from `holo-lexer`.
- Changed `holo-lexer` to depend on `holo-token`.
- Re-exported `Token` and `TokenKind` from `holo-lexer` to minimize changes in other crates that depend on `holo-lexer`.
- Updated unit tests in `holo-token` to verify functionality after the migration.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/lexer/src/types.rs` for the existing `Token` and `TokenKind` definitions.
- `crates/token/src/lib.rs` for the target placeholder definitions.
- `crates/lexer/Cargo.toml` to add the dependency on `holo-token`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- That re-exporting the types from `holo-lexer` would be the least disruptive way to handle the migration while still technically moving the source of truth to `holo-token`.

**Other Notes:**
- `cargo check` passes for the entire workspace.
- `cargo test -p holo-token` passes.

### 22:20 - Incremental Compilation Design Document [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
create a new design document for incremental compilation. Incremental compilation should happen in stages:

1. Tokenize and parse changed files to ASTs.
2. Extract function and struct names from AST and put them in a lookup table
3. Resolve parameter names in function signatures
4. Resolve and typecheck function bodies
5. Run tests (only for changed tests and tests impacted by code changes).

For each stage, detail when the step can be omitted since the result is the same as a previous step

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Defined a 5-stage incremental pipeline.
- Specified omission logic for each stage based on content hashes, AST structure matches, and signature stability.
- Structured the design such that signature resolution is decoupled from body typechecking to maximize cache hits.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/DESIGN.md` for the existing query-driven compiler architecture high-level goals.
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-minimal-continuous-compiler-plan.md` to see previous planning for the continuous compilation daemon.
- `crates/query/src/lib.rs` to understand the existing `QueryStore` implementation.
- `crates/ast/src/statement.rs` to see how `FunctionItem` and `Module` are currently structured.

**Assumptions Made:**
- Assumed a query-driven model where each stage's output is cached by its specific input dependencies.
- Assumed that "Semantic AST" comparison would be used to avoid invalidation due to whitespace or comment changes.

**Other Notes:**
- Discussed potential pitfalls like parameter name renaming and transitive type invalidation with the user.

### 22:30 - Create holo-engine crate [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
Create a new engine crate for handling the incremental compilation stages. For now just create a simple lib crate

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Created `crates/engine` directory.
- Defined `holo-engine` package in `crates/engine/Cargo.toml` with dependencies on `holo-base` and `holo-query`.
- Added `crates/engine` to the root workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- Implemented a minimal `lib.rs` with a version function and unit test.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Root `Cargo.toml` for workspace structure.
- `crates/query/Cargo.toml` for dependency patterns.

**Assumptions Made:**
- Assumed standard project naming convention (`holo-engine` for the package name).

**Other Notes:**
- Verified the new crate with `cargo check -p holo-engine`.

### 22:35 - Implement Engine struct [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
create a bare engine struct in its own file

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Created `crates/engine/src/engine.rs` to hold the `Engine` struct.
- Included an `InMemoryQueryStore` within the `Engine` to support the query-driven design.
- Re-exported `Engine` from `lib.rs` for easier access by consumers.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/query/src/lib.rs` for the `InMemoryQueryStore` type.

**Assumptions Made:**
- Assumed `InMemoryQueryStore` should be the initial storage backend for the engine's query system.

**Other Notes:**
- `cargo check -p holo-engine` passes.

### 22:32 - Remove holo-query dependency from holo-engine [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
remove the holo-query dependency for now

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Removed `holo-query` from `crates/engine/Cargo.toml`.
- Remove `InMemoryQueryStore` field and its import from `crates/engine/src/engine.rs`.
- Simplified `Engine` struct to be bare for now.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/engine/Cargo.toml` and `crates/engine/src/engine.rs`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The engine will be built up incrementally without the query store dependency in this step.

**Other Notes:**
- `cargo check -p holo-engine` passes.

### 22:36 - Switch to Forward Incremental Approach [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
remove all reference to a query driven approach from the plan, I think I'd like to go with a simpler forward incremental approach

**Issues Encountered:**
- None.

**Decisions Made:**
- Updated `docs/plans/2026-02-27-incremental-compilation-design.md` to replace "query-driven" terminology with "forward incremental".
- Updated `crates/engine/src/engine.rs` documentation to reflect the forward incremental approach.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-27-incremental-compilation-design.md` and `crates/engine/src/engine.rs`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- The logic for skipping stages (omission logic) remains largely the same, but the execution model is now conceptualized as a push-based forward pipeline rather than a pull-based query system.

**Other Notes:**
- The engine's purpose remains to coordinate the 5 defined compilation stages.
