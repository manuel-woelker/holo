### 20:30 - Remove lexeme field from Token struct [opencode/minimax-m2.5-free]

**User Prompt:**
Remove the lexeme field from the Token struct and instead make it a method that takes a &SourceFile. Adapt all relevant methods to use &SourceFiles as parameters instead of plain &str as source.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Had to fix borrow checker issues when calling `self.lexeme(token)` multiple times - had to clone the string to avoid conflicting borrows
- Had to fix `SourceExcerpt::new` calls to pass `&self.source.source` instead of `&self.source` since it expects a string type, not SourceFile

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a `lexeme(&self, source: &SourceFile) -> SharedString` method to Token that extracts the text using `source.source_at(self.span)`
- Added a helper method `fn lexeme(&self, token: &Token) -> &str` in ParserState to avoid repeated borrow issues
- Changed Parser trait and implementations to take `&SourceFile` instead of `&str`
- Created SourceFile instances in core and cli to pass to the parser

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Reviewed SourceFile::source_at method which extracts text by span
- Reviewed ParserState struct to understand how source is used

**Assumptions Made:**
- That the lexeme extraction would be simple enough to inline via the method
- That creating SourceFile instances in core/cli would be straightforward

**Other Notes:**
- All tests pass including parser and lexer tests
- check-code.sh passes with no issues

### 22:05 - Move Token type from lexer crate to token crate [antigravity]

**User Prompt:**
move the Token type from the lexer crate to the token crate, replacing the token type there

**Issues Encountered:**
- None. The transition was straightforward because the placeholder `Token` in the `token` crate was minimal and could be entirely replaced by the version from `lexer`.

**Decisions Made:**
- Replaced `Token` and `TokenKind` in `holo-token` with the full implementations from `holo-lexer`.
- Changed `holo-lexer` to depend on `holo-token`.
- Re-exported `Token` and `TokenKind` from `holo-lexer` to minimize changes in other crates that depend on `holo-lexer`.
- Updated unit tests in `holo-token` to verify functionality after the migration.

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- `crates/lexer/src/types.rs` for the existing `Token` and `TokenKind` definitions.
- `crates/token/src/lib.rs` for the target placeholder definitions.
- `crates/lexer/Cargo.toml` to add the dependency on `holo-token`.

**Assumptions Made:**
- That re-exporting the types from `holo-lexer` would be the least disruptive way to handle the migration while still technically moving the source of truth to `holo-token`.

**Other Notes:**
- `cargo check` passes for the entire workspace.
- `cargo test -p holo-token` passes.
