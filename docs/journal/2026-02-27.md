### 20:30 - Remove lexeme field from Token struct [opencode/minimax-m2.5-free]

**User Prompt:**
Remove the lexeme field from the Token struct and instead make it a method that takes a &SourceFile. Adapt all relevant methods to use &SourceFiles as parameters instead of plain &str as source.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Had to fix borrow checker issues when calling `self.lexeme(token)` multiple times - had to clone the string to avoid conflicting borrows
- Had to fix `SourceExcerpt::new` calls to pass `&self.source.source` instead of `&self.source` since it expects a string type, not SourceFile

**Decisions Made:**
- Added a `lexeme(&self, source: &SourceFile) -> SharedString` method to Token that extracts the text using `source.source_at(self.span)`
- Added a helper method `fn lexeme(&self, token: &Token) -> &str` in ParserState to avoid repeated borrow issues
- Changed Parser trait and implementations to take `&SourceFile` instead of `&str`
- Created SourceFile instances in core and cli to pass to the parser

**Technical Info Consulted:**
- Reviewed SourceFile::source_at method which extracts text by span
- Reviewed ParserState struct to understand how source is used

**Assumptions Made:**
- That the lexeme extraction would be simple enough to inline via the method
- That creating SourceFile instances in core/cli would be straightforward

**Other Notes:**
- All tests pass including parser and lexer tests
- check-code.sh passes with no issues
